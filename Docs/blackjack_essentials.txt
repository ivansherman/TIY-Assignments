BlackJack Essentials (before coding)

* The dealer and each player get two cards. The dealer's first card faces up, the second faces down. Face cards each 	count as 10, Aces count as 1 or 11, all others count at face value. Any First 2 cards with an Ace with any 10,
	Jack, Queen, or King is a "Blackjack."

	### A method to shuffle a deck and deal 2 cards to the player and 2 cards to the dealer must be made

* If you have a Blackjack, the dealer pays you one-and-a-half times your bet - unless the dealer also has a Blackjack,
	in which case it's a "push" and neither wins.

		### We have to define methods to test winner hands, losing, and still in the game.

* If you don't have a Blackjack, you can ask the dealer to "hit" you by using a scratching motion with your fingers
	on the table.

* The player may draw as many cards as you like (one at a time), but if you go over 21, you "bust" and lose. If you
	do not want to "hit," you may "stand" by making a side-to-side waving motion with your hand.



After the player is satisfied with its hand, the dealer will turn his or her down card face up and stand or draw as necessary.
